pokwm
=====

`pokwm` is yet another tiling window manager with design goals based now
largely on fusing the parts I like of other tiling managers:

* 	Be kind of like XMonad (which I like for being written and extensible in
	Haskell, a language I understand better than C)
*	Be kind of like ratpoison (which I like for everything else)
*	Don't crash on my computer at work like ratpoison does

Currently, as of the 0.0.0 release, all it does without changing keybindings
is:

*	mod4-tab: rotate through your windows
*	mod4-s: split into two half-and-half vertical panes
*	mod4-u: undo a split
*	mod4-e: rotate through panes
*	mod4-enter: spawn a uxterm
*	mod4-k: kill the current window

And it doesn't even do it very well!  Look forward to future releases.

:bomb: **NOTE:** This is now a completely dead project, since I don't primarily use X11 anymore!
